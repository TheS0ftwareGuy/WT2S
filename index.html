            <p>This website summarizes my four-month co-op work term as an AI Software Developer at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) in downtown Toronto. During the term, I contributed to an AI-assisted workflow that connects design specifications with software implementation. The site highlights what I worked on, what I learned, and how the experience contributed to my professional development.</p>

            <p>Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is a global IT services and consulting company that works across enterprise software, digital transformation, and applied artificial intelligence. As part of the Tata Group, TCS supports large organizations by building and maintaining scalable, production-level software systems used across a wide range of industries.</p>

            <p>I was based in the downtown Toronto office, where teams collaborate across engineering, design, and product roles. Working in this environment gave me direct exposure to enterprise-scale development practices, cross-functional workflows, and the practical application of AI technologies in real-world business contexts.</p>

            <p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </p>

            <h2>Goals and Learning Outcomes</h2>

                <img src="pic03.jpeg" alt="Work environment and daily routine">
            </div>

            <h3>Initial Goals</h3>

            <p>At the beginning of this work term, I set learning goals that aligned closely with my role as an AI Software Developer and the responsibilities of the position. I aimed to develop a practical understanding of generative AI systems used for code generation, particularly how design ideas can be translated into functional front-end code through large language models. In addition, I wanted to strengthen my ability to critically evaluate AI-generated outputs, improve my technical documentation skills, and collaborate effectively within a professional AI engineering team.</p>

            <p>These goals were chosen to support both my immediate job tasks and my long-term development as a computing professional. Gaining experience with generative AI APIs and design-to-code workflows was especially important, as these technologies are becoming increasingly relevant in modern software development and will be directly applicable to future co-op terms and full-time roles.</p>
            
            <h3>Reflection and Outcomes</h3>

            <p>By the end of the work term, I successfully achieved the majority of my learning goals through hands-on experimentation, structured testing, and regular collaboration with my team. I developed a stronger understanding of how AI-assisted development workflows function in practice and became more confident in configuring prompts and evaluating model behavior to produce usable code aligned with design intent. I also learned to identify recurring issues in generated outputs and apply systematic problem-solving approaches to improve reliability and consistency.</p>

            <p>Beyond technical growth, I improved my ability to communicate complex ideas through clear documentation and constructive discussions with team members. Participating in feedback cycles and team-based decision-making strengthened my collaboration skills and reinforced the importance of aligning individual contributions with shared objectives. Overall, this experience significantly advanced my technical literacy, critical thinking, and professional readiness for future roles in the computing field.</p>

        <section id="job-description">
            <h2>Job Description</h2>

            <p>I worked as an AI Software Developer Co-op supporting an AI-assisted workflow designed to translate visual design layouts into functional, maintainable code. The role involved working at the intersection of software engineering, design systems, and machine learning, where I evaluated structured representations of designs, supported model-assisted code generation, and collaborated with team members to develop validation strategies that improved output reliability and consistency.</p>

            <p>One of the most unique aspects of this work term was experiencing a corporate environment for the first time. Working within a large organization introduced me to structured workflows, formal review processes, and the pace of enterprise-level development. As TCS is a consultancy company, I also worked with one of its clients, which meant regularly transitioning between the TCS office and the client’s office during the week. Adapting to different workspaces, team cultures, and expectations was both challenging and rewarding, and it helped me develop flexibility and professionalism in a real-world setting.</p>

            <p>The role required a mix of technical and soft skills. On the technical side, I worked with Python, JavaScript, and React Native, as well as large existing codebases that included unfamiliar tools and frameworks. While some foundational skills such as JavaScript and general programming concepts were introduced in university courses, much of the technical learning, particularly React Native and navigating complex, unfamiliar code, took place on the job through independent learning and experimentation. Strong communication, teamwork, and time management skills were also essential, and while these were developed in university settings, this role allowed me to apply and strengthen them in a professional environment with real deadlines and shared responsibilities.</p>
